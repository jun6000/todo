### Note
Since the `todo` executable doesn't have any dependencies, feel free to move it around to other paths of your choice as well. A new blank `tasks.txt` file will be created if not already present in the new path to store tasks.

### Special Mentions
Thank you very very much [Shan](https://github.com/xyzshantaram) for the original idea and support!!
